## Development with docker-compose

### Platform Architecture
As the primary development is conducted on macOS, the platform has been specifically configured for the ARM64 architecture to ensure optimal performance and compatibility.

Starting the Services
To initiate the necessary services using Docker Compose, execute the following command in your terminal:

```shell 
docker-compose up -d
```

#### Live Code Updates
Any modifications to the codebase will be automatically reflected in real-time. You can view these changes by navigating to `http://localhost:4000/` in your web browser.

#### Stopping the Services
To gracefully shut down and remove the running containers, use the following command:
```shell
docker-compose down
```
